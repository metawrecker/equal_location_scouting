This mod updates all unique / legendary locations that are supposed to be visible on the world map to 100% visibility. This means that you can find locations like the Icy Cave without walking right by it 12 times. Unique locations will be found once they are in the edge of your vision radius, like a regular enemy camp. 

Locations hidden by default, such as the Artifact Reliquary, are not changed. Once you defeat the pre-req location, such as the Icy Cave, the game will automatically update the newly revealed location to 100% visibility. 

This mod should be fine to add or remove at any time. The unique location visibility is updated once each time you load a save or start a new run.

Pre-reqs:
modding script hooks
Modern Hooks
Modding Standards and Utilities (MSUI)
